# LostInTransit

## Lost in Transit
Lost in Transit is a mod for Risk of Rain 2 that adapts various items from Risk of Rain 1, intending to balance and redesign them in ways that preserve their original identites while also respecting the balance and gameplay changes made in Risk of Rain 2.
If you have any issues with the mod, you can contact me on Discord (swuff★#2224) - shoot me a DM or ping me in a mutual server. As a personal note: I'm still really new to modding, so expect issues.

## Credits
First off: A lot of code is taken from ThinkInvis's ClassicItems and TILER2. I can't thank ThinkInvis (and any other contributors to either) enough for their work on those two mods, as this mod likely wouldn't be here without either.
With that out of the way,

* Code - chen, swuff★, ThinkInvis
* Art/Modelling/Animation - bruh
* Writing - Lyrical Endymion
* Additional support/special thanks - Anreol, KomradeSpectre, rob, xpcybic

## Changelog

### 0.1.0
* Beckoning Cat: Added
  * Uncommon tier item, giving a chance to drop items after killing elite monsters. (Developer note: This item was originally the "56 Leaf Clover" in Risk of Rain 1, but was changed due to the inclusion of "57 Leaf Clover" in Risk of Rain 2. To help prevent confusion betwen the two, the item was given a complete overhaul - may provide a config option to restore this into the 56 Leaf Clover if there's demand for it.)
