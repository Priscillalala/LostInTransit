# Lost In Transit
Lost in Transit is a mod for Risk of Rain 2 that adapts various items from Risk of Rain 1, intending to balance and redesign them in ways that preserve their original identites while also respecting the balance and gameplay changes made in Risk of Rain 2.

In its current state, the mod is intended to be an adaptation over a pure port - some items may have changed function or identities for varying reasons. A config is planned to return items to be as 1:1 as possible later down the line.

If you have any issues with the mod, you can contact me on Discord (swuff★#2224) - shoot me a DM or ping me in a mutual server. As a personal note: I'm still really new to modding, so expect issues.
